// kept here rather than called: that helper sits in the same barrel
// (`testing/index.js`) as `mountSite`, which imports `createViewer.js`, which
// imports the raw `AppRoot.vue`. Vite and Vitest load `vite.config.js` with
// plain Node, before any `.vue`-aware transform exists, so importing the
// barrel from here fails immediately with
// `ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION` on `AppRoot.vue` — reproducible with nothing
// but Node itself:
// `node --input-type=module -e "import('@museumwnf/viewer-core/testing')"`.
// Filed as metanull/viewer-core#86. `tests/smoke.test.js` imports the same
// barrel safely, because Vitest loads test files through its own transform
// pipeline rather than plain Node. Switch this back to
// `...defineViewerConfig({ dataPackage: '@museumwnf/woodwork-data', plugins: [vue()] })`
// once the package exposes it somewhere that does not pull in `.vue`.

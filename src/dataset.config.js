  // first in `extraViews`, keeping only its own routes after it — home, item
  // and the entrances into the collection, the timeline and the partners
  // section, which stay the website's own because they read this dataset's
  // shape rather than the shape the factory already covers. Route names and
  // paths are pinned inside the factory to what every DXA site already
  // registers, so a deep link or a `legacyRoutes` entry targeting one of them
  // keeps resolving unmodified — never redeclare one of those names or paths
  // here. This scaffold is `standalone`, which has no standard routes: the

  // must never carry a live import of the DXA entry point.
